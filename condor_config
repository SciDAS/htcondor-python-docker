##  condor_config
##
##  This is the global configuration file for condor. This is where
##  you define where the local config file is. Any settings
##  made here may potentially be overridden in the local configuration
##  file.  KEEP THAT IN MIND!  To double-check that a variable is
##  getting set from the configuration file that you expect, use
##  condor_config_val -v <variable name>
##
##  condor_config.annotated is a more detailed sample config file
##
##  Unless otherwise specified, settings that are commented out show
##  the defaults that are used if you don't define a value.  Settings
##  that are defined here MUST BE DEFINED since they have no default
##  value.

##  files in a given directory that don't match a regex as configuration files.
##  Config files are read in lexicographic order.
